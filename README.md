Original product description [from 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610092815/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Plus/dme/music.asp#dancer):
> Your desktop becomes a virtual dance floor as amazingly lifelike, 3-D figures dance to the beat of your favorite tunes. Choose from a variety of dancers and dance styles, including hip-hop, disco, salsa, and more.
> 
> Get to know Amanda, Cobey, and all the other Plus! dancers by reading their bios online, and then download more of your favorite dancers to your computer.


MacPlusDancer is a delightfully nostalgic macOS app that brings back the dancers from Microsoft Plus! (their exclamation point, not mine).

- Choose from a variety of dancers with different styles
- Drag and position dancers anywhere on your screen
- Dancers stay on top of other windows for maximum visibility
- Toggle dancing on and off (except for Seth, he must dance forever)

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/samhenrigold/MacPlusDancer/releases) page.
2. Select a dancer from the menu bar icon (a dancing figure).
3. Position your dancer by dragging them around the screen.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

_NOTE: If you submit a PR to make Seth stop dancing, it will be rejected._

## Legal Note

The dancer animations are from the original Microsoft Plus 2003 application. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft. It's a fan-made port created for educational and nostalgic purposes.
